# My Tabs Helper

This repository contains the source code for **My Tabs Helper**, a simple Firefox extension for managing open tabs. The add-on provides quick filtering, duplicate detection, a full grid view and optional dark theme. The popup lists tabs from the current window while the full view shows tabs from every open Firefox window. A keyboard shortcut can unload all open tabs to free memory. See the `mytabs` directory for the extension files.
