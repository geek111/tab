# KepiTAB

This repository contains the source code for **KepiTAB**, a simple Firefox extension for managing open tabs. The add-on provides quick filtering, duplicate detection, a full multi-column view and optional dark theme. The popup lists tabs from the current window while the full view shows tabs from every open Firefox window. Multiple selected tabs can be dragged together to any position. A keyboard shortcut can unload all open tabs to free memory. The options page allows toggling features like the Recent and Duplicates panels and lets you set the tile width used in the full view. See the `mytabs` directory for the extension files.
