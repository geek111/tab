- Tabs can be reordered via drag and drop, including moving multiple selected tabs at once.
- A **Full View** window shows tabs in multiple columns filled top-to-bottom.
  - Custom context menu reveals extension version and links to the Options page.
  - The mouse wheel scrolls the tab list even when the pointer is over the menu or search field.
  - Scroll speed can be adjusted from the Options page to make scrolling more aggressive.

  the Recent and Duplicates panels or the Move command.

- Keyboard shortcuts open the popup, sidebar and full view.
