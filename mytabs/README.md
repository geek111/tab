# My Tabs Helper

This is a minimal open source Firefox add-on inspired by the features of **All Tabs Helper**.

## Features

- Displays a list of all open tabs.
- Search tabs by title or URL.
- Activate, unload or close tabs from the list.
- Move a tab to another open window if available.
- Highlights duplicate tabs (tabs with the same URL).
- Keyboard shortcut `Alt+Shift+H` to open the helper popup.

To install for development, load the directory as a temporary add-on in Firefox.
